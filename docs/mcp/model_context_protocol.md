# 🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI: it offers a universal way to connect AI models to various data sources and tools.

## 🚀 Why Use MCP?

- **Plug-and-Play Integrations:** Easily connect your LLM to a growing list of pre-built integrations.
- **Provider Flexibility:** Switch between LLM vendors without changing your integration approach.
- **Security Best Practices:** Keep your data secure within your own infrastructure.

MCP uses a client-server architecture, allowing host applications to connect to multiple servers and data sources:

- **MCP Hosts:** Apps like Claude Desktop, IDEs (VS Code), or AI tools accessing data via MCP.
- **MCP Clients:** Maintain 1:1 connections with MCP servers.
- **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs exposing capabilities through MCP.
- **Local Data Sources:** Files, databases, and services on your computer.
- **Remote Services:** External APIs and internet services.

This setup lets LLMs and AI tools securely access both local and remote data, enabling powerful, context-aware AI applications.
